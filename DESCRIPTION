Title: File Locking Interoperable With Perl File::NFSLock
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Brian Davies
Maintainer: Brian Davies <daviesbj@bp.com>
Description: Allows multiple worker processes with no common parent or
    arbiter to negotiate exclusive access to a file. Exploits the
    fact that hard linking to a pre-existing file is atomic, even
    under NFS. Designed to be interoperable with the File::NFSLock
    package in Perl, so R and Perl programs can cooperate in this
    way. Hoping to eventually add a Python version.
